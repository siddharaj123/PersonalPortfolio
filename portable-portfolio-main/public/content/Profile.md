## About
I'm a software developer who loves bringing efficient web applications to life, thanks to my experiences at CapTech Consulting and BAE Systems. But my interests don't stop at coding! In my downtime, I enjoy whipping up new recipes, crafting with my sewing kit, and transforming spaces with my interior design skills. It's all about creating something memorable, whether it's online or at home.but also aesthetically pleasing.
